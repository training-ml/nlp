    " VADER ( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. It is available in the NLTK package and can be applied directly to unlabeled text data.\n",
    "VADER sentimental analysis relies on a dictionary that maps lexical features to emotion intensities known as sentiment scores. The sentiment score of a text can be obtained by summing up the intensity of each word in the text.\n",
    "For example- Words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is intelligent enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “did not love” as a negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “ENJOY”\n",
